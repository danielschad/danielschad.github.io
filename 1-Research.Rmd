My two main interests are in different lower- and higher-level processes in reading and computational psychiary / decision-making.

### Reading

My research focusses on how the eyes move across the text during reading. I study basic questions of controlling attention and eye-movements, and currently start investigating also higher-level syntactic and sentence processing. In particular, I am interested in mindless reading, that is, the experience that during reading our minds wander off the text and to completely different issues. I am interested in how eye-movement control, attention, and higher-level text processing do or do not change during mindless reading. To study these questions, I use eye-tracking, signal detection analyses of error detection (mindless reading), hierarchical statistical and dynamical systems computational modeling (SWFIT model).

### Computational Psychiatry and Decision-Making

My second main research focus is on learning and decision-making in computational psychiatry. I study basic mechanisms of learning and decision-making, including the arbitration between model-free and model-based instrumental decisions. Moreover, I investigate basic processes in Pavlovian conditioning by looking at sign- and goal-tracking in healthy human subjects. Moreover, I apply models of learning and decision-making to understand the processes underlying addicition to alcohol. In particular, I study the hypotheses that alcohol dependence reflects model-free or Pavlovian responses. I study these questions using eye-tracking, choice behaviour, and computational reinforcement learning (RL) modelling in combination with fMRI.
