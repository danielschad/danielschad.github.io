<h3><strong>PhD position (m/f/d) – Reinforcement learning during
Pavlovian conditioning</strong></h3>
<p>The HMU Health and Medical University is a private state-recognized
university located in the Villa Carlshagen in Potsdam. It was founded in
2017 by the managing director Ilona Renken-Olthoff and started operating
with two departments (Department of Medicine and Department of Health
and Sports) in the winter semester 2020/21. The HMU offers study
programs in human medicine (state examinations), in psychology (bachelor
and master), and other bachelor’s and master’s degree programs.</p>
<p>The campus at the Villa Carlshagen is located directly on Lake
Templin and offers optimal conditions for a unique learning and working
atmosphere in the midst of the greenery of the state capital Potsdam.
The hospital Ernst von Bergmann in Potsdam is our cooperation partner
for the clinical part of the state examination course in human
medicine.</p>
<p>The University of Potsdam hosts leading groups in cognitive sciences
and linguistics, providing a vibrant interdisciplinary scientific
environment (<a
href="http://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cognitive-sciences/index.html"
class="uri">http://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cognitive-sciences/index.html</a>).
The lab will be associated with two Collaborative Research Centers
relevant to its research focus, namely CRC 1287 „Limits of variability
in language” (<a href="https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/en"
class="uri">https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/en</a>) and CRC 1294
„Data assimilation: The seamless integration of models and data“ (<a
href="https://www.sfb1294.de/"
class="uri">https://www.sfb1294.de/</a>).</p>
<p>We are looking for an academic staff member with focus on research
(m/f/d) – Reinforcement learning during Pavlovian conditioning (75%
position for 3.5 years, equivalent E13 TV-L) to support our team
starting in January 2026 or later. The position is conditional on a
final funding decision for CRC 1294 (3rd funding period; which is very
likely since it has been rated as excellent).</p>
<p>Your tasks: You will work on a project aimed at investigating
individual differences in Pavlovian conditioning, namely human
“sign/goal tracking” (see e.g. Schad et al., 2020, Nature Human
Behavior; www.quentinhuys.com/tcpw/events/daniel-schad/), including
model-free and model-based Pavlovian and instrumental learning, as well
as other state-of-the-art computational learning processes. The activity
will take place under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Daniel Schad (Chair of
Quantitative Methods at the HMU in Potsdam) and in cooperation with
Prof. Dr. Ralf Engbert (Chair of Cognitive and Biological Psychology,
University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany). It will be situated in a
collaborative research center (CRC 1294; www.sfb1294.de) on “Data
assimilation” at the University of Potsdam.</p>
<p>The position is a very good opportunity for a candidate with
expertise/interest in programming (R, Matlab, Python) and behavioral and
eye tracking data to conduct cutting-edge research in reinforcement
learning during Pavlovian conditioning, respectively, and to work on an
exciting research project that includes international publications and
scientific presentations.</p>
<p>The position involves</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing, programming, and running experiments on reinforcement
learning.</li>
<li>Conducting advanced analyses of eye tracking and behavioral data,
including computational cognitive modeling (reinforcement learning
theory).</li>
<li>Preparing manuscripts for publication in international journals
(peer-review) and presenting results at international conferences.</li>
<li>Working on a PhD.</li>
</ul>
<p>We offer</p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting scientific environment at a new and growing
university in beautiful surroundings</li>
<li>An excellently equipped eye tracking laboratory</li>
<li>Excellent computational resources</li>
<li>Support by student research assistants</li>
<li>A friendly and open working atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideal candidate will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A very good master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g., psychology,
cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, medicine, computational
sciences, …)</li>
<li>Experience with or interest in methods of behavior analysis</li>
<li>Excellent statistical skills</li>
<li>Good programming skills (e.g., R, Matlab, …) or very high motivation
to learn these programming languages</li>
<li>Skill in / high interest in learning computational cognitive
modeling</li>
<li>Excellent writing, communication, and presentation skills (in
English)</li>
<li>Research experience or a strong interest in the professorship’s area
of work, e.g., cognitive and computational psychology / neuroscience /
computational psychiatry, reinforcement learning, decision making,
Pavlovian conditioning</li>
<li>Systematic and independent working style</li>
<li>Excellent organizational and teamwork skills, strong motivation and
commitment</li>
<li>No German language proficiency is required</li>
</ul>
<p>Potsdam is a very beautiful historic city and its palaces are UNESCO
World Heritage Sites. In addition, Potsdam is within commuting distance
to Berlin, a culturally vibrant and progressive city. Both cities have a
high quality of life.</p>

vitae, degree certificates, with at least one name + email for a
